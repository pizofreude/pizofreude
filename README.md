- 👋 Hi, I’m @pizofreude
- 👀 I’m interested in CAE, full stack, FOSS and cycling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker alongside K8s.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to: CAE Engineering (limited to CAD, FEM & CFD at the moment. Acoustics and Machine Learning Engineering maybe down the line), PowerBI, Python (Django, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java (limited to CATIA v5 scripting), C++ (limited to OpenFOAM), MySQL, FreeCAD, Autodesk Fusion 360, CATIA v5, ANSYS WB, MATLAB, FluidSIM, MEDINA, PERMAS, OpenFOAM and MS Office packages.
- :100: My productivity tools: Notion, Miro, Figma&Figjam, Inkscape, Slack, MS Teams, Dropbox, GDrive, GCalendar, VMware Workstation Player, Pocket. Researching for encrypted backup software such as Duplicati 2.0, any suggestions are highly appreciated 😃
